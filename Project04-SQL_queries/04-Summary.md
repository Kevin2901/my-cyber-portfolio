SUMMARY:



\# I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. 



\# I used two different tables, log\_in\_attempts and employees. 



\# I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task.



\# I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
