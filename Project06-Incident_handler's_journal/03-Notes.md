Notes:



\# I really found the activity using tcpdump challenging. I am new to using the command line, and learning the syntax for a tool like tcpdump was a big learning curve. At first, I felt very frustrated because I wasn't getting the right output. I redid the activity and figured out where I went wrong. What I learned from this was to carefully read the instructions and work through the process slowly.



\# My understanding of incident detection and response has definitely evolved. I had some basic understanding of what detection and response entailed, but I didn't fully understand the complexity involved. I feel that my understanding has changed, and I am equipped with more knowledge and understanding about incident detection and response.



\# I really enjoyed learning about network traffic analysis and applying what I learned through network protocol analyzer tools. It was my first time learning about network traffic analysis, so it was both challenging and exciting. I found it really fascinating to be able to use tools to capture network traffic and analyze it in real time. I am definitely more interested in learning more about this topic, and I hope to one day become more proficient in using network protocol analyzer tools.
