SUMMARY:



The vulnerability‑assessment report describes a high‑capacity Linux server hosting a MySQL database that stores critical marketing data and is protected by SSL/TLS encryption. Using NIST SP 800‑30 as a framework, the assessment evaluates three primary threat sources—external hackers (likelihood 3, severity 3, risk 9), insider employees (likelihood 2, severity 3, risk 6), and customers (likelihood 1, severity 3, risk 3). It concludes that the greatest risk stems from external attackers seeking to exfiltrate sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, the report recommends hardening access controls through strong passwords, role‑based permissions, multi‑factor authentication, comprehensive auditing, migration from SSL to TLS for data‑in‑motion encryption, and IP allow‑listing to restrict database connectivity to trusted corporate networks.
