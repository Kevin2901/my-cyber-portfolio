SCENARIO: 



\# You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.





\#REVIEW THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VULNERABLE SERVER



we have provided you with the System Description and Scope of the Vulnerability assessment report in the template provided. Vulnerability assessments include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project.

Review the System Description and Scope of the Vulnerability assessment report.

The System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.

The Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the server — not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.





\#PERFORM A RISK ASSESSMENT 



Once you have reviewed  the  system description and scope, you will write  a purpose statement. The purpose section helps stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of your analysis. A purpose statement also connects the technical objectives of your analysis with the organization's goals.

Consider what you know about the server:

* How is the database server valuable to the business?
* Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
* How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?



1. Explore the Threat sources section of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource. Using what you know about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described.

In the Threat Source column of the Risk Assessment table, identify three potential threats. Choose the threats based on the information you have gathered from the system description, scope, purpose, and NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource.

2. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 provides a comprehensive list of possible security events that could compromise a vulnerable information system — labeled Threat events. This list covers what attackers from different groups typically try to achieve and how good they are at it. For example, a business competitor might have the technical capabilities needed to conduct a denial of service attack.
3. Refer to the likelihood and severity sections of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource and ask yourself the following questions about each threat that you identified earlier:

   * How frequently could this happen?
   * Would critical business functions be impacted?
   * How might this affect the business and its customers?

Then, estimate a Likelihood score (1-3) and Severity score (1-3) for each threat and add your scores to the corresponding columns of the Risk Assessment table in your template. After that, calculate an overall Risk score (1-9) for each threat using the formula (likelihood x severity = risk).





\# PROPOSE SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS



This helps stakeholders understand your thought process of evaluating the risks you've identified — adding valuable context for stakeholders.

You are conducting a qualitative vulnerability assessment, which relies on subjective judgment to assess the likelihood and severity of risks. Your task here is to estimate how bad attacks could be by judging their chances based on your security knowledge. Qualitative vulnerability assessments are useful for identifying high-level risks facing an organization. This information helps organizations make informed decisions about resource allocation, project planning, and other aspects of their business operations.
