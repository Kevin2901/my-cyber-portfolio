\# The incident report correctly follows the NIST‑style phases, but the organization could improve its resilience by adding upstream DDoS mitigation rather than relying solely on a local firewall rule, refining ICMP rate‑limits to allow essential types while dropping echo‑request floods, and establishing baseline traffic profiles with flow‑based monitoring to detect spikes more rapidly.



\# Automating containment using scripted shutdowns of non‑critical services and predefined escalation contacts will speed response, while preserving packet captures ensures evidence for forensics or legal action.



\# After the event, a structured post‑mortem that records quantitative metrics, updates IDS signatures, and revises firewall rules will close the loop, network segmentation, redundant links, and employee awareness further reduce future impact. Including these enhancements in the documentation and assigning clear owners will make the incident‑response process more robust and measurable.
