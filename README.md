# my-cyber-portfolio

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Portfolio repository. This repo contains a blend of executable assets (Python scripts, SQL schemas, Linux commandline utilities) and the supporting documentation (risk assessments, incident response playbooks, journals) that describe the security concepts behind each project. Everything is organized so you can either run the code directly or study the methodology in the accompanying docs.

| # | Project | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Internal Audit | Managing security risks by auditing |
| 2 | Incident Analysis | Analysis of internal network traffic |
| 3 | Linux File Permissions | Apply File permissions in Linux CLI |
| 4 | SQL queries | Use database to grep files |
| 5 | Vulnerability Assessment | How to handle when a vulnerability is found |
| 6 | Incident Handler's Journal | A jounal entry of an incident |
| 7 | Update a file through a Python Algorithm | Automate files using Python |

📚 DOCUMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

NIST-CSF-framework --  is a set of voluntary guidelines created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It is organized into core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, plus a Govern function added in version 2.0

NIST-SP-800-30-Rev.1 -- is a cybersecurity risk assessment guide. It outlines a flexible, structured, repeatable process for identifying, evaluating, ranking, and addressing information security risks.


🛠️ Adding New Projects

Contributions are encouraged—whether you’re improving documentation, fixing a script, or adding a brand‑new lab. Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/<short‑name>).
3. Make your changes, ensuring that any new scripts run cleanly (./test_all.sh is provided at the repo root to sanity‑check all projects).
4. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of what you changed and why.
